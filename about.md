<p class="message">
   My name is Jason Bilyeu and I am a Software Architect living in Austin, TX.

I really enjoy building high-quality software using the latest Java server-side technologies and javascript client-side libraries.  Some of my recent work has used these libraries/frameworks:

* Spring Boot
* Spring Cloud
* Spring Data JPA
* Project Lombok
* Spock Testing Framework
* AngularJS

I love to learn about new client and server technologies, and I created this blog to share some of my recent learnings.  Thanks for reading!
